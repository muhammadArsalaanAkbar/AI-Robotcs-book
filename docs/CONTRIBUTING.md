# Contributing to "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"

Thank you for contributing to the technical accuracy and quality of this book! Your expertise is invaluable.

## Review Guidelines for Technical Accuracy

When reviewing content, please ensure adherence to the following:

1.  **Factual Accuracy**: Verify all statements, facts, and figures are correct and up-to-date within the robotics and AI fields.
2.  **Technical Correctness**: Ensure all technical explanations, algorithms, and methodologies are sound and correctly described.
3.  **Real Robotics Terminology**: Confirm the correct usage of robotics, AI, and engineering terminology. Avoid jargon where simpler terms suffice, but do not oversimplify at the expense of precision.
4.  **Code Snippet Validation**: Review all Python + ROS 2 (rclpy) and Isaac Sim Python API code snippets for:
    *   **Correctness**: Does the code perform its stated function?
    *   **Realism**: Is the code representative of real-world robotics development?
    *   **Executability**: Is the code logically executable (even if not run in a live environment during review)?
    *   **No Hallucinations**: Ensure no fabricated libraries, APIs, or hardware references are present.
5.  **Diagram Accuracy**: Verify that ASCII architecture diagrams accurately represent the described systems and their interactions.
6.  **Hardware/Software References**: Check that all mentions of hardware (RTX Workstations, Jetson, RealSense, IMUs, Unitree robots) and software (ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Nav2, LLM/Speech APIs) are correct and contextually relevant.
7.  **Clarity for Engineering Students**: Is the content clear, concise, and easy for engineering students to understand? Are complex topics broken down logically?
8.  **Consistency with Constitution**: Ensure the chapter adheres to the principles outlined in the `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (e.g., emphasis on embodied intelligence, logical progression).
